# Characteristics of Insertion Sort:
* This algorithm is one of the simplest algorithm with simple implementation
* Basically, Insertion sort is efficient for small data values
* Insertion sort is adaptive in nature, i.e. it is appropriate for data sets which are already partially sorted.

# Working of Insertion Sort algorithm:
Consider an example:
arr= {12, 11, 13, 5, 6}

First Pass:
* Initially, the first two elements of the array are compared in insertion sort.

* Here, 12 is greater than 11 hence they are not in the ascending order and 12 is not at its correct position. Thus, swap 11 and 12.
* So, for now 11 is stored in a sorted sub-array.
