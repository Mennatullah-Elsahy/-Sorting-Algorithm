| [Insertion Sort](https://github.com/Mennatullah-Elsahy/Sorting-Algorithms/tree/master/Insertion-Sort)  | Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.|
| [Merge Sort](https://github.com/Mennatullah-Elsahy/Sorting-Algorithms/tree/master/Merge-Sort)    | The Merge Sort algorithm is a sorting algorithm that is based on the Divide and Conquer paradigm. In this algorithm, the array is initially divided into two equal halves and then they are combined in a sorted manner.|
| [Kruskal's](https://github.com/Mennatullah-Elsahy/Sorting-Algorithms/tree/master/Kruskal's-Algorithm)    | Kruskal algorithm to find the minimum cost spanning tree uses the greedy approach. This algorithm treats the graph as a forest and every node it has as an individual tree. A tree connects to another only and only if, it has the least the  cost among all available options and does not violate MST properties.|
